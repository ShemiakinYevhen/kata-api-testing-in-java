Title: Swagger "Try it out" feature returns 404 on all requests.

Description: Both controllers (booking and auth) are giving 404 status code and html error page in the response.

Steps to reproduce:
    1. Open any swagger url (https://automationintesting.online/auth/swagger-ui/index.html or https://automationintesting.online/booking/swagger-ui/index.html)
    2. Expand any request details (e.g. auth -> login)
    3. Click on "Try it out" button
    4. Enter "admin" value for "username" field
    5. Enter "password" value for "password" field
    6. Click on "Execute" button

Expected: Valid response should be displayed with 200 status code and body containing "token" field with token value

Actual: Error response is displayed with 404 status code and html error page body

Note: It appears that swagger does not add "/api" path into url, so as a workaround it can be manually added in the postman for example
